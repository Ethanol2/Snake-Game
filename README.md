# Snake-Game
A snake game created in Godot
This project was started for the Boot.Dev personal project module. This is my first project using the game engine Godot.

## Game Features
- Basic snake gameplay. You start as a dot and grow as you collect the targets. If you collide with your tail its game over.
- Grid, speed and edge wrapping are configurable with multiple options. Each set of options tracks scores indepentally.
- Sound effects
- Music
  - Music becomes more intense the closer the player is to the target
  - Can be disabled
- Save System
  - Saves the last ruleset used.
  - Saves the music enabled setting

## Download
I've exported the game for Windows and Linux because I can test these platforms.
